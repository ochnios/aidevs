## Repo with solutions to tasks from [AI_Devs](https://www.aidevs.pl/) course.

Here's what I accomplished in the course:

✅ Gained a deep understanding of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and how they power assistants like ChatGPT and Copilot

✅ Learned how to connect to OpenAI models via API and integrate them with my own applications

✅ Discovered the risks and limitations associated with using LLMs in applications and strategies to mitigate them

✅ Got acquainted with automation tools like make.com, which significantly simplify prototyping applications, especially those leveraging various external services

✅ Completed several small projects using GPT models to enhance my daily work

### TODO

- add task hints
- add missing prompt tasks solutions
